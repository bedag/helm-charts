  Next Steps

    1. Visit the Crowd Setup page and finish the setup manually:

        {{ include "bedag-lib.utils.notes.public" (dict "ingress" $.Values.ingress "service" $.Values.service "context" $)| indent 8 }}


    NOTE: Before you can join additional nodes go through the setup process and complete it. Otherwise you
      will have a hard time bootstraping the Crowd cluster.

    2. Confirm Crowd Setup is complete:

        {{ include "bedag-lib.utils.notes.public" (dict "path" "/crowd/console/setup/setuplicense.action" "ingress" $.Values.ingress "service" $.Values.service "context" $) | indent 8 }}


    3. Configure Crowd to your needs.

  Upgrade

    To upgrade your Crowd cluster, first visit the upgrade page:

    Then you can simply change the image tag to the newer version. For more details take a look at the README.md.
