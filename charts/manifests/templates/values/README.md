# Values

This directory serves to store default values for manifests and presets. Only change here something if you know what you are doing.

## Values Generator

This library ships with a Values Generator, which allows to generate values.yaml suitable values for each manifest/preset. We highly recommend using the generator for creating your Values:

  * [../utils/README.md#generator](../utils/README.md#generator)

### Plugin

To make life easier, we created a dedicated helm plugin to generate values. [See the Generator Helm Plugin]((https://github.com/bedag/helm-manifests-plugin))
