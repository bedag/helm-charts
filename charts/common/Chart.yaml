description: A common Helm chart to use for creating other Helm charts

version: 7.0.0

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.

# Because linting (in helm-v3.0.0) doesnt work correctly we use type application
type: application
