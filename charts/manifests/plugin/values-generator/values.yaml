## Enabled Values Generator
doc:

  ## doc.manifest -- Define which manifest to generate (e.g. "statfulset")
  manifest: ""


  # doc.preset -- Define which preset to render (e.g. "permissions")
  preset: ""

  # doc.path -- If you want your values to be in a more complex structure, you can define the yaml path. This mostly matters for all the helm-docs fields being generated.
  #path: "custom.sub.path"
  path: ""

  ## Overwrite the top key for the values.
  ## E.g. for the manifest statefulset the default top key is "statefulset", which has all other
  ## keys as child. With this option you can change this key to e.g. "frontend"
  key: ""

  ## A single manifest can have a lot of values. With enabling minimal output the values
  ## which come from sub templates or manifests will only be referenced as comment but not printed
  ## to keep your values slim.
  minimal: false
